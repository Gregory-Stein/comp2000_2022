Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
The two sites are very similar and provide the same service - that is a cloud storage space that allows for easy versioning and branching of a project and it's matereals - the differences I could find is that github includes a percentage graph of the different file types, a place to hold discussion, and a many other methods to see and parcel out the contrabutions of multiple people. bitbucket has a space labelled "Jira Issues" which I can't find if github also has. If I had to make a definitive statement I'd say github is better when working on a project with a team or multiple teams, while bitbucket might be more useful for solo projects due to a lack of fluff to slow down navigation or loading. 

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  Matthew Roberts.

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
Jon Mountjoy.

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
Dave Pearce.

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
Both projects are active. Project A updated 20 days ago, and Project B 21 days ago.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
The source code in both are fairly active, although recently Project B has been getting a lot of tests.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
